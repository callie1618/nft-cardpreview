## Overview

To complete the challenge using HTML and CSS. I used CSS Flexbox to style the card in this challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

- Built the html section first. I divided the elements into sections and added classes for each section and element. For CSS, I used Flexbox for layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I will be learning CSS Grids next since it wasn't covered in the webdev course I'm taking. 


### Useful resources

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io/) - I really liked this website since it's easier to search for what I'm looking for.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - I was having a hard time trying to apply the effect I wanted and this article helped a lot.
